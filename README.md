# dexter_health

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
To run the app, all you have to do is run "flutter run" in your terminal


The current features on the app:
1. Creating a Nurse account
2. Add resident detail
3. Add todo
4. Mark/Unmark todo as done
5. Pick resident from a list of residents while creating a todo list

Features I would like to implement I had more time:
1. Transfering of unfinished todo list to the next shift by filtering out completed tasks
2. Detail page for full detail on task/todo which should show the full details about the resident to be attended to.[ Please note: I have already mapped the residentId to each todo list created]
3. Proper login and logout for different nurses at the Home.
4. I would like to take more information about the resident on the "Add resident page".
